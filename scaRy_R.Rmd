# Introduction

I write this blog as a reflection of my personal journey in learning `R` as a programming language. I will use **`r version[['version.string']]`** throughout the blog. I intend it to be read by seasoned R users as well as new R users whom have not even downloaded the program, just to have a glimpse of the reality that lies ahead.

Learning `R`, like any other programming language, is normally received by learners (especially those with _zero_ background in programming) with awe. Why? Because it normally comes from people with experience, who have used the program for a long time that they forget how a new user should get into the learning process. 

# ScaRy comments

 - We cannot teach you everything in `R` `r emo::ji("face")`. 
 
 - From the basics we have given you, it is now upon you to explore more and learn `r emo::ji("cry")`.
 
 - Now you can fetch your own data and rerun the scripts `r emo::ji("sad")`.
 
 - All the scripts are available on GitHub repository.
 
 - Make sure you have the latest version of `R` and `RStudio`.
 
 - You can then run everything in Docker container `r emo::ji("love")`.
 
 - Kindly share your RMarkdown via our `Slack` channel.
 
 - There is also option to use `RStudio Cloud`.
 
 - Follow my instructions otherwise it will throw an `Error` `r emo::ji("ear")`.
 
 - Google is your best friend, the R community is huge.
 
 - read.csv, why not just import_csv?
 
 - You can get help by typing ? followed by the function name.

These are some of the statements that return potential `R` users back to regular spreadsheets. Let me tell you how.

A pro in Excel, SPSS, and other related GUI based applications are hugely discouraged by these statements. I wish I could know the population of potential `R` users who dropped the package the first day because of one or more of the sentences listed above. They are just so many out there.
